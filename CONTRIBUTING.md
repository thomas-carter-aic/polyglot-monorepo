## 4. Development Workflow

### Building

```bash
bazel build //...
```

### Running Tests

```bash
bazel test //:all_tests
```

### Formatting / Linting

```bash
# Go
bazel run //:lint_go

# Python
bazel run //:lint_python

# Node
bazel run //:lint_node

## 5. Pre-Commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce linting and formatting:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## 6. Pull Request Guidelines

* Branch from `main` and create a descriptive name.
* Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
* Run all linters and formatters before opening a PR.
* Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
* Link the PR to any relevant issue or changelog entry.

---

## 7. Reporting Issues

* Open GitHub issues for bugs, feature requests, or questions.
* Include enough context to reproduce the issue (logs, versions, steps).

---

## 8. Security

Report security vulnerabilities privately via [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
