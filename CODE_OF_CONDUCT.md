# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in this
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse,
inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
